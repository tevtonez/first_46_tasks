Task 20
Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Python dictionary in the following
fashion {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":gott",
"new":"nytt", "year":"Ã¥r"} and use it to translate your Christmas cards from
English into Swedish. That is, write a function translate() that takes a list
of English words and returns a list of Swedish words.
